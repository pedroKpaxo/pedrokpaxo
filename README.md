### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a designer who loves to code in python and typescript.
Creator of [**PETROVIEWS**](https://petroviews.web.app), a geological interface of brazilian oil and gas assets.

I also developed the [FastDlis](https://github.com/MonumentoSoftware/fast-dlis) a fast terminal app for quickly analysing .DLIS files.
